Have you ever wanted to run your own Minecraft server without the monthly hosting fees? Or needed a way to play with friends on a reliable platform that doesn't slow down when your computer goes to sleep? In this post, I'll share how I leveraged Oracle Cloud's Always Free tier to create a robust Minecraft server solution that costs absolutely nothing.

## The Problem

Running a Minecraft server traditionally presents several challenges:
- Commercial hosting services can be expensive ($5-20/month)
- Running the server on your own computer ties up resources and requires keeping your PC on
- Home connections often have dynamic IPs and limited upload bandwidth
- Power outages or internet disruptions can cause progress loss

I wanted a solution that would be completely free, reliable, and professionally managed without sacrificing performance.

## The Solution: Oracle Cloud VM + Automation

Oracle Cloud offers genuinely free virtual machines that are perfect for game servers. I created a solution using:
- Oracle Cloud's Always Free ARM-based VM (4 OCPUs, 24GB RAM)
- Official vanilla Minecraft server software
- SSH remote access for management
- Tmux for persistent sessions
- Cron jobs for automated backups to Amazon S3
- Proper firewall configuration

This setup provides the reliability of commercial hosting without any ongoing costs.

### Creating the Oracle Cloud Account and VM

The first step was setting up the cloud infrastructure:

1. Created an Oracle Cloud account at [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com)
2. Verified my account using a credit card (required for verification, but not charged)
3. Created a new VM instance with the following specifications:
   - OS: Oracle Linux 7.9
   - Shape: Ampere (ARM-based, Always Free eligible)
   - Resources: 4 OCPUs and 24GB RAM (maximum free allocation)
   - Boot volume: 100GB

4. Generated and downloaded an SSH key pair for secure access
5. Noted the public IP address assigned to the VM

*Obviously not my own instance, but you get the idea*

### Accessing the Server Remotely

With the VM running, I needed to establish secure remote access:

1. Connected to the server via SSH from my terminal:
   ```bash
   ssh opc@<server-ip-address> -i /path/to/private_key
   ```

2. Updated the system packages:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

3. Installed essential utilities:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install wget tmux nano -y
   ```

### Setting Up the Minecraft Server

With remote access established, I could now install and configure the Minecraft server software:

#### Installing Java

Minecraft requires Java to run, so I installed the latest compatible version:

```bash
sudo yum install jdk-17 -y
```

Verified the installation:

```bash
java --version
```

#### Downloading and Configuring Minecraft

1. Created a dedicated directory for the server:
   ```bash
   mkdir minecraft
   cd minecraft
   ```

2. Downloaded the official vanilla Minecraft server:
   ```bash
   wget https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server
   mv server.jar minecraft_server.jar
   ```

3. Started the server for initial setup:
   ```bash
   java -Xmx8G -Xms8G -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
   ```
   
   This allocates 8GB of RAM to the Minecraft server, which is plenty for a small to medium-sized server with multiple players.

4. Accepted the EULA:
   ```bash
   nano eula.txt
   # Changed eula=false to eula=true
   ```

5. Configured server properties:
   ```bash
   nano server.properties
   ```
   
   Key settings I modified:
   - *server-port=25565* (default Minecraft port)
   - *difficulty=normal*
   - *max-players=10*
   - *view-distance=10*
   - *spawn-protection=0*
   - *enable-command-block=true*

### Setting Up Port Forwarding and Firewall Rules

To make the server accessible from the internet, I configured the necessary network settings:

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console:
   - Navigated to the VM's VCN (Virtual Cloud Network)
   - Accessed Security Lists for the public subnet
   - Created ingress rules for port 25565 (TCP and UDP)

Unlike some setups, I didn't need to configure the Linux firewall manually as the Oracle Cloud interface handled this entirely.

### Implementing Server Persistence with Tmux

To keep the server running even after disconnecting from SSH, I set up Tmux:

1. Started a new Tmux session:
   ```bash
   tmux new -s minecraft
   ```

2. Launched the Minecraft server within the Tmux session:
   ```bash
   java -Xmx8G -Xms8G -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
   ```

3. Detached from the session without stopping the server:
   - Pressed *Ctrl+B* and then *D*

To reconnect to the session later:
```bash
tmux attach -t minecraft
```

This setup ensures the server continues running even when I'm not actively connected through SSH.

### Automating Backups to Amazon S3

To prevent data loss, I implemented an automated backup solution:

1. Installed and configured the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

2. Configured AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Entered access key, secret key, region, and output format
   ```

3. Created a backup script:
   ```bash
   nano backup.sh
   ```

   Contents of backup.sh:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Load the user's profile to ensure all environment variables are set
   source /home/opc/.bashrc

   # Set the PATH to include locations of all necessary binaries
   PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

   # Define server directory, backup directory, S3 bucket name, and log file
   SERVER_DIR="/home/opc/Server"
   BACKUP_DIR="/home/opc/backups"
   S3_BUCKET="s3-mc-backup"
   TMUX_SESSION="minecraft"
   LOG_FILE="/home/opc/minecraft_backup.log"

   # Start logging
   echo "Starting Minecraft backup process at $(date)" >> $LOG_FILE

   # Navigate to the server directory
   cd $SERVER_DIR

   # Send stop command to the Minecraft server running in tmux
   tmux send-keys -t $TMUX_SESSION "/stop" C-m
   echo "Sent stop command to Minecraft server" >> $LOG_FILE

   # Wait for the server to stop
   sleep 60
   echo "Server stopped, proceeding with backup" >> $LOG_FILE

   # Define backup file name
   BACKUP_FILE="minecraft_backup_$(date +"%Y%m%d").tar.gz"

   # Create a new backup with today's date
   tar -czf $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE $SERVER_DIR
   echo "Backup file created: $BACKUP_FILE" >> $LOG_FILE

   # Upload the backup to S3
   aws s3 cp $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE s3://$S3_BUCKET/$BACKUP_FILE >> $LOG_FILE 2>&1
   echo "Backup file uploaded to S3" >> $LOG_FILE

   # Delete local backups older than 5 days
   find $BACKUP_DIR -name 'minecraft_backup_*.tar.gz' -mtime +5 -exec rm {} \;
   echo "Deleted local backups older than 5 days" >> $LOG_FILE

   # Delete backups older than 7 days from S3
   aws s3 ls s3://$S3_BUCKET/ | grep 'minecraft_backup_' | while read -r line; do
      CREATE_DATE=`echo $line|awk {'print $1" "$2'}`
      FILENAME=`echo $line|awk {'print $4'}`
      OLD_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d" --date="7 days ago")
      if [[ "$CREATE_DATE" < "$OLD_DATE" ]]; then
         aws s3 rm s3://$S3_BUCKET/$FILENAME
         echo "Deleted $FILENAME from S3" >> $LOG_FILE
      fi
   done

   # Start the server within tmux session
   # Check if the tmux session exists, create it if not
   if ! tmux has-session -t $TMUX_SESSION 2>/dev/null; then
      tmux new-session -d -s $TMUX_SESSION
      echo "New tmux session created" >> $LOG_FILE
   fi

   # Send the command to start the server in tmux
   tmux send-keys -t $TMUX_SESSION "cd $SERVER_DIR" C-m
   tmux send-keys -t $TMUX_SESSION "./run.sh" C-m
   echo "Minecraft server started" >> $LOG_FILE

   echo "Minecraft backup process completed at $(date)" >> $LOG_FILE
   ```

4. Made the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x backup.sh
   ```

5. Set up a cron job to run the backup every night at 5 AM:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   # Added the line:
   0 5 * * * /home/opc/backup.sh
   ```

This ensures that backups are created automatically and stored safely in cloud storage, protecting against data loss.

## Results

After setting everything up, I had a fully functional Minecraft server that:

- Runs 24/7 with no monthly costs (completely free)
- Offers excellent performance with 4 dedicated OCPUs and 8GB RAM allocation
- Maintains uptime even during client disconnections
- Automatically backs up to secure cloud storage
- Provides a low-latency experience for multiple concurrent players
- Can be managed remotely from any device with SSH capability

The Oracle Cloud VM has proven remarkably stable, and using Tmux ensures that server sessions persist even if my SSH connection drops. The automated backups provide peace of mind, knowing that player progress is safe even in the event of a catastrophic failure.

For anyone looking to host their own Minecraft server without ongoing costs, Oracle Cloud's Always Free tier offers an exceptional solution that rivals paid hosting services in terms of performance and reliability.
