A few days ago, the cryptocurrency **Pi Network** officially entered the OKX trading platform, currently showing a promising value of **$1.8 per Pi**. Let's look back at an adventure that started as simple entertainment among friends and might today become an excellent financial surprise.

## Pi Network, mobile version crypto mining ðŸ“±

For those who don't know Pi Network yet, it's a unique cryptocurrency: the first crypto that could be mined directly from a simple smartphone, without needing enormous computing power or expensive equipment. Everything started in **December 2018**, when the team behind Pi Network launched the mobile application in Alpha phase. The concept intrigued, attracted curious people, but remained relatively unknown.

Personally, my adventure with Pi began in 2020. At that time, I was just 15 years old, and with a few friends, we decided to test this "weird" crypto simply out of curiosity. The process was easy: a daily click to "mine" Pi, almost no consumption of phone resources, and a friendly spirit of competition among friends to see who would mine the most Pi.

## From Testnet to Mainnet blockchain ðŸ”—

Pi Network has gone through several key phases in its evolution:

- **Phase I (Beta)**: Officially launched on **March 14, 2019**, this period was for the first pioneers, exploring still unknown territory.
- **Phase II (Testnet)**: From **March 2020**, the network opened to worldwide testing, allowing real progress toward a decentralized blockchain accessible to all.
- **Phase III (Mainnet)**: Starting **December 2021**, the Pi blockchain entered a closed Mainnet period ("Enclosed Mainnet"), where users could migrate their Pi to the real blockchain while participating in the development of community applications.

I thus continued to mine quietly, accumulating Pi without really believing in their future value. I took it more as a game in the exciting but uncertain universe of cryptocurrencies.

## The 2025 surprise: my personal experience ðŸŽ‰

This week, as Pi has just been publicly listed on OKX, reality caught up with me: this small, innocuous experiment started for fun among friends has become very concrete. With nearly **700 Pi** collected in about 70 days of mining (thanks also to some invited friends), I now hold almost **$1,260** at the current rate of $1.8 per Pi.

This experience clearly shows how a simple interest in technology can sometimes become a great opportunity. Of course, no one could predict exactly this valuation at the time, but that's precisely the magic of the cryptocurrency world: sometimes the risk is zero and the surprise is great.

## Why not you? ðŸš€

Pi Network remains an interesting opportunity today. It's still possible to mine for free, without notable effort and without any risk. So, why not try your luck and participate in this new crypto project?
